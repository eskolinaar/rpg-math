- Save to LocalStorage:
- Campaign mode uses this.
- Variable in map (savemode="all"|"none") defines if map resets or not on load/if states are saved
- option to reset the game (=delete all variables beginning with "save"

prefix: save
for everything from savegame

prefix: mapname
for everything belonging to a map

what to save:
- maplist                   | save#maplist = "exercise.list.json"
- difficulty                | save#difficulty = { "label":"1", "add":"10" }
- position&direction        | save#position = { "x":"7", "x":"7", "dir":"1" }
- current map               | save#map = "21-01-01-100.map.json"
- current quest status      | save#quest = { ... all parameters ... }
- quest status [m] [*]      | save#21-01-01-100.map.json#quest_5/3 = "1"
- token status [m]          | save#21-01-01-100.map.json#token_15/2 = "1"
- mob alive [m] [*]         | save#21-01-01-100.map.json#mob_15/2 = "1"


example:
save#21-01-01-100.map.json#mob_12/13 = "1"
==> the mob in the map ... at position 12/13 has been killed. He should not respawn on entering map


[m] ... map prefix

[*] when saving the quest status of a map-quest,
    the given position is the starting position of the mob handing it out
[*] when determining if a mob is killed, the starting position of the mob is used

Update 28.11.2021
Problem: what if token are picked before quest is accepted?
         => issue respawn
         => saving token state is nonsense
         => same is true for mob kills
         => dont save token/mob states

Maybe game state should be saved per maplist
